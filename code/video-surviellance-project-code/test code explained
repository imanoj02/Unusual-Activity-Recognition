The first few lines import the necessary libraries: 
```
import cv2
import numpy as np 
from keras.models import load_model
import argparse
from PIL import Image
import imutils
```
- `cv2` is the OpenCV library used for image and video processing.
- `numpy` is used for numerical computations.
- `keras` is a high-level neural networks API used for building and training models.
- `argparse` is used for parsing command-line arguments.
- `PIL` is the Python Imaging Library used for image processing.
- `imutils` is a library containing convenience functions for OpenCV.

The following code defines a function called `mean_squared_loss` that calculates the mean squared loss between two inputs:
```
def mean_squared_loss(x1,x2):
    difference=x1-x2
    a,b,c,d,e=difference.shape
    n_samples=a*b*c*d*e
    sq_difference=difference**2
    Sum=sq_difference.sum()
    distance=np.sqrt(Sum)
    mean_distance=distance/n_samples

    return mean_distance
```
This function is used later in the script to calculate the mean squared loss between the input and output of the pre-trained model.

The next line loads a pre-trained Keras model from a saved file:
```
model=load_model("saved_model.h5")
```
This model is used later in the script to predict the output for a given input.

The following lines open a video file using OpenCV and check if it was successfully opened:
```
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("test_video.mp4")
print(cap.isOpened())
```
If the video file was successfully opened, `cap.isOpened()` will return `True`.

The next part of the code contains a loop that reads each frame of the video, processes it, and predicts its output using the pre-trained model:
```
while cap.isOpened():
    imagedump=[]
    ret,frame=cap.read()

    for i in range(10):
        ret,frame=cap.read()
        image = imutils.resize(frame,width=1000,height=1200)

        frame=cv2.resize(frame, (227,227), interpolation = cv2.INTER_AREA)
        gray=0.2989*frame[:,:,0]+0.5870*frame[:,:,1]+0.1140*frame[:,:,2]
        gray=(gray-gray.mean())/gray.std()
        gray=np.clip(gray,0,1)
        imagedump.append(gray)

    imagedump=np.array(imagedump)

    imagedump.resize(227,227,10)
    imagedump=np.expand_dims(imagedump,axis=0)
    imagedump=np.expand_dims(imagedump,axis=4)

    output=model.predict(imagedump)
```
For each frame, it reads and resizes it using `imutils.resize()`. It then resizes it again using `cv2.resize()` to a size of 227x227 pixels, converts it to grayscale, normalizes it, and appends it to a list called `imagedump`. After processing ten frames, it converts the list to a NumPy array and reshapes it to a size of 227x227x10. It then expands the dimensions of the array to be compatible with the input shape of the pre-trained model. Finally, it passes the input to the model and predicts its output.

The next part of the code calculates the mean squared loss between the input and output using the previously defined `mean_squared_loss()` function:
```
loss=mean_squared_loss(imagedump,output)
```
If the loss is greater than a threshold value of 0.00068, it overlays text on the video frame indicating an abnormal event:
```
if loss>0.00068:
    print('Abnormal Event Detected')
    cv2.putText(image,"Abnormal Event",(220,100),cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX,2,(0,0,255),4)
```
Finally, if the user presses 'q' or the end of the video is reached, the script stops:
```
if cv2.waitKey(10) & 0xFF==ord('q'):
    break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()




This code is a Python script for detecting abnormal events in a video using a pre-trained deep learning model. It uses OpenCV, NumPy, Keras, argparse, PIL, and imutils libraries. 

The script loads a pre-trained deep learning model from a saved file and reads a video file. It then processes each frame of the video by resizing it, converting it to grayscale, normalizing it, and appending it to a list. After processing ten frames, it passes the list to the pre-trained model and calculates the mean squared loss between the input and output. If the loss is greater than a threshold value, it considers it an abnormal event and overlays a text on the video frame. If the user presses 'q' or the end of the video is reached, the script stops.
